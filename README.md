Take is a TypeScript-based task runner aimed at providing a solution to create Makefiles that are powerful yet need little extra config. Take is based on the following principles:

  - This means making sure it can be used to its fullest without needing a package.json
- Provide a simple yet powerful task system that is easy to use, write and read
- Provide utility functions that allow writing the most powerful task runner with the least amount of code
- Be small and lightweight to fit into any system without issues
